# Traffic Light Management using RL
___

This repository contains my work on contolling traffic lights in road intersections using Deep Reinforcement Learning. This repository will be a collection of my experiements and code. It is a work in progress and the structure and content of the repo can and will change in the future. As of now, Im working on creating a good RL agent for a single intersection and then I shall move to a grid.
